# Development

This document describes how to build, test, and deploy **PKG Manager**.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-pkg-manager.git
# Or if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## How to Build


### 1. Build the Frontend
You must build the React UI first. This compiles the JSX into the single-file bundle that gets converted into C header assets:
```bash
make frontend-build
```

To use the Vite dev server against a console:
```bash
cd frontend && PKG_BACKEND=192.168.1.50:8844 PKG_NO_HMR=1 npm run dev
```
The dev server proxies the API and upload WebSocket (`PKG_BACKEND_WS_PORT`,
default 18842). Disable HMR while installing: browser-backed jobs need their
source tab, and reloading it cancels those jobs. Console-accessible jobs keep
running in the backend.

### 2. Build the SDK Docker Image
If you haven't already, build the PS5 payload SDK Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t ps5-payload-sdk-pkgmgr -f Dockerfile.sdk .
```

### 3. Build the ELF
Compile the native ELF using the Docker container. It is recommended to run `make clean` before rebuilding if headers or frontend changed:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src ps5-payload-sdk-pkgmgr make clean all
```

The resulting `pkgmgr.elf` will be created in the root directory.

The build also creates `build/install-helper.elf` and embeds it in `pkgmgr.elf`.
Only `pkgmgr.elf` is deployed. Package installs require an elfldr service on
`127.0.0.1:9021` at runtime. The daemon sends its embedded helper to elfldr;
the launched process identifies itself as `pkgmgr-inst.elf`.

### 4. Build a Versioned Development Binary
To build a versioned development binary (`pkg-manager_v<VERSION>-dev-<SHORT_HASH>.elf`):
```bash
./build_release.sh
```

### Cache invalidation
Routine ELF version changes preserve the on-console metadata and icon cache. If
a change makes those persisted entries incompatible, increment
`CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `frontend/src/App.jsx`; that triggers one cache clear
and catalog scan for each browser profile. The package manifest has its own
`PKG_MANIFEST_VERSION` in `src/pkg_scanner.c`, which should be incremented when
the saved catalog format or classification rules require a rescan without
discarding cached metadata and icons.

## Running Unit Tests

You can run the full host test suite locally without Docker:
```bash
make test
```

`make test-install-queue` exercises the real backend scheduler with a controlled
installer: FIFO, dependency blocking and retry, independent removal, worker
cleanup before advancing, offline submission, browser ownership, duplicate
admission, malformed batches and process-lifetime queue reset.

With a built frontend, `node tools/queue-ui-smoke.mjs` starts a local mock server
and headless Chrome. It checks base/update removal, bulk DLC actions, browser
reload, queue panel rendering and a browser upload continuing during navigation.
Set `CHROME_BIN` if Chrome is not installed at the default macOS location.
`PKG_MOCK_OFFLINE=1 npm run mock` simulates system-managed submission.

`make test-install-service` exercises the actual helper protocol in freshly
executed host processes with stubbed PS5 APIs. It covers consecutive installs,
single-submission enforcement, native failures, malformed IPC, helper death,
cancellation, parent disconnection, and graceful/forced child cleanup. It also
tests the real launcher against a fake elfldr: ELF upload, upload half-close,
loopback IPC callback, and missing-loader failure. Host tests do not emulate
the PS5 loader or AppInstUtil, so console validation remains necessary.

For console validation, install at least two packages without restarting the
manager, then exercise a base/update batch, consecutive Direct Installs, and a
cancel followed by another install. The manager PID should stay constant; each
attempt should report a distinct helper PID. Check both older firmware and an
affected newer firmware.

### Collecting install diagnostics from users

Enable **PKG install debug** before reproducing the issue. Collect the generated
`stream_debug_*.txt` report from `/data/pkgmgr/` (or `PKG_DEBUG_DIR`) and the full
`/api/log` response. Stream reports contain HTTP/WS events and remain open across
transport retries until helper cleanup finishes. Names include PID and sequence
to avoid overwriting same-second attempts; retention is 20 stream reports.

The daemon's recent log includes helper launch, IPC failures, native return codes,
status changes, and process cleanup. Native status snapshots are written on
changes and every 30 seconds while unchanged. The helper also writes startup
and native-call details to `/data/pkgmgr/helper-log.txt`; the daemon copies that
file into its log when startup or cleanup fails.

`/api/log` retains the latest **2,048 lines**, at most **1 MiB** in its fixed
buffer. The ordinary `install.log` stores warnings/errors only.

This compiles and runs tests for:
- Package parser (`test_pkg_parser`)
- Drive and package scanner with manifest caching (`test_pkg_scanner`)
- Package cache and settings (`test_pkg_cache`)
- Installer state machine and space checks (`test_installer`)
- Orphaned update and DLC detection (`test_leftovers`)
- Edge cases and error handling (`test_edge_cases`)
- Multi-part packages and virtual stream engine (`test_multipart`)
- PS5 installer stream simulation (`test_stream_sim`) — pairs the PS5
  request-pattern simulator (`tests/ps5_sim.c`) against the real stream
  server (`src/stream_server.c`) on the host; no PS5 required (see below)
- Direct Install WebSocket transport and live-stream tests (`test_ws_upload`,
  `test_ws_stream`, `test_ws_stream_far`, `test_direct_install_e2e`)
- In-memory package parsing (`test_parse_mem`)
- Legacy CSS syntax transformer (`test_fix_legacy_css.py`)

### Large SMB share regressions

For live authentication and throughput testing against Windows or Samba, see
[SMB diagnostics](docs/SMB_DIAGNOSTICS.md). The host probe uses the production
SMB reader and the patched library without running the installer.

`make test TESTS=test_smb_scan` generates 3,000 small synthetic PKGs in separate
games, updates and DLC folders, using the real scanner/parser over the local SMB
transport mock. It checks:

- overlapping full scans perform one traversal (the original implementation
  reproduced two traversals: 16 directory opens instead of 8);
- background admission, progress and catalog access during directory I/O;
- directory enumeration closes before metadata reads;
- cursor paging reaches every file in a 1,000-entry folder without opening PKGs;
- a nested directory failure preserves the quick-scan catalog and reports a full
  scan error;
- browse-only settings persist, perform no scan I/O, remove previously indexed
  entries, and still allow parsing an individually selected file.

`cd frontend && npm test` covers scan polling through a transient connection
failure, reconnecting without another scan request, manual browse/inspect requests,
and rendering 60 cards from 3,000 titles, including the last page.

To manually inspect the frontend with a large synthetic catalog, build the
frontend once, then run the mock server (which serves both the UI and mock API):

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
PKG_MOCK_COUNT=3000 npm run mock
```

Open `http://localhost:8844`. The mock API adds synthetic SMB packages to the
main catalog; the default mock remains the small hand-authored demo.
`PKG_MOCK_COUNT` can be set to another total, up to 20,000.

These tests validate application behavior with a mocked SMB transport. A live
PS5/NAS run is still needed to confirm console memory limits, server timeouts,
controller interaction and installation from the reporter's share.

### PS5 Installer Stream Simulator

`test_stream_sim` reproduces the exact HTTP request pattern the PS5 background
package installer sends to the stream server (`:18841`), so install methods
(websocket client, direct stream creation) can be developed and verified on the
host without a console. It is modeled from the captures in
`.for_reference/stream_debug/`: a burst of header re-reads, a `*.crc` sidecar
probe that must 404, then two parallel bulk connections serving contiguous
16 MiB byte-ranges.

- It is built and run automatically by `make test` (listed in `TESTS`, with
  `tests/ps5_sim.c` in `TEST_SRCS`).
- `tools/ps5_installer_sim.c` is the standalone CLI half — it can point the
  same replay at any live server (`--no-server --port 18841`), or be fully
  self-contained: build a fixture PKG, start a local stream server, replay the
  PS5 pattern, and print a reference-format replay log.
- `tools/run_stream_sim.sh` builds and runs the CLI:

  ```bash
  tools/run_stream_sim.sh --demo          # build fixture, replay, print log
  tools/run_stream_sim.sh --no-server     # replay against an existing server
  ```

### Direct Install over WebSocket

The Direct Install page lets a LAN browser, such as a PC, push a local `.pkg` to the
daemon, which streams it straight into the installer from RAM — nothing
is stored on disk. Install can start as soon as the header is parsed,
while the rest still uploads:

- Transport: `src/ws_upload.c` (`include/ws_upload.h`) — RFC6455 listener
  on `:18842`, in-order chunks with resume. Narrow REST hook in
  `src/http_server.c` (`POST /api/upload/init|finish|cancel`,
  `GET /api/upload/status`); chunk bytes never go through MHD.
- Live session: `src/ws_stream.c` (`include/ws_stream.h`) — 1 MB pinned
  header cache + configurable RAM ring (64 MB default, `WS_LIVE_RING_MB`),
  blocking readers, bounded writer admission, and abort/timeout handling.
  Served through the existing HTTP range path via the `live:<id>`
  virtual-stream scheme (`src/multipart.c`, `src/stream_server.c`).
- Metadata: additive `pkg_parser_parse_mem()`; install entry
  `installer_start_live()`; `/api/queue/attach` binds a selected job to its owned `live:` URI.
- Frontend: `DirectInstallView.jsx` + `api/directInstall.js` +
  `hooks/useDirectUpload.js`, `hooks/useInstallQueue.js` and app-wide file drop.
  The navbar opens the shared install panel. Browser jobs start only when the
  backend selects them; the source tab supplies their File objects.
- Upload scheduling: the sender uploads the header first, then follows installer
  seeks with a bounded window of up to eight 1 MiB segments and up to two
  uploads in flight.
  Busy replies retry the same segment; requests for in-flight segments are
  coalesced. The WebSocket listener starts on demand and closes when idle.
- With install debug mode enabled, the install queue shows WebSocket receive
  and install speed graphs. Stream logs include build identity, receive and
  accepted throughput, cache duplicate/reload/eviction counters, and periodic
  browser file-read and send-to-ACK timing summaries. The selected debug
  directory keeps at most 20 stream logs and 20 SMB logs.
- Host tests (all in `make test`): `test_ws_stream` (ring unit),
  `test_parse_mem` (parse vs parse_mem differential),
  `test_ws_upload` (codec + socket + fragmentation), `test_direct_install_e2e`
  (concurrent push + PS5 pull, abort fail-fast, small-ring wrap,
  `installer_start_live` commit).
- Simulators: `tools/ws_push_sim.c` via `tools/run_direct_install_sim.sh`:

  ```bash
  tools/run_direct_install_sim.sh --demo                # concurrent push+pull
  tools/run_direct_install_sim.sh --demo --resume-test  # drop + resume
  tools/run_direct_install_sim.sh --pkg game.pkg --port 18842  # live server
  ```

- Frontend mock: `node frontend/mock-server.js` serves the same REST shape
  plus a memory-backed mock WS listener on `:18842`.
- The sender scheduler also has focused Node.js tests, separate from `make test`:
  ```bash
  cd frontend && npm run test:upload
  ```

## Automated Deploy

For a fast build and deploy cycle over the local network, use the `deploy.sh` script:
```bash
./deploy.sh [PS5_IP]
```
(Requires PS5 IP as the first argument; sends `pkgmgr.elf` via `socat` to port 9021).

### Shared install queue

`src/install_queue.c` owns up to 256 jobs in memory while the daemon runs. All
installation UI actions submit to `/api/queue`. Legacy file `/api/install` and
`installer_start_batch` requests also enqueue jobs; base/update is no longer a
special installer handoff. Batch admission is atomic and pending duplicates are
skipped. The current run's byte-weighted progress resets after the queue drains.

Jobs move through queued, checking, preparing (browser), installing/canceling,
and completed/submitted/failed/blocked/canceled states. Failed source jobs require
Retry. Blocked dependencies remain visible while other eligible jobs continue;
retrying or adding a base moves its blocked dependents behind it. Eligibility
and storage are checked again before execution. Multipart media swaps retain a
waiting state inside the active job.

Browser upload initialization and attachment require the selected job ID and
its private owner token. Polling exposes only a short source identifier. Source
tabs send heartbeats and an unload disconnect; a missing heartbeat cancels their
jobs after 20 seconds. Queued browser jobs hold no upload sessions. Reloading or
closing their source tab cancels those jobs; select the files again to retry.
Other clients can view and control the shared queue.

System-managed USB/disc installs finish in the app when the PS5 accepts the
submission. They are labeled **Submitted to PS5**, never Installed. The queue
then submits the next job without polling for completion, guessing a timeout,
or asking for confirmation. An earlier submitted base satisfies offline
submission ordering for its updates/DLC. Installation progress, outcomes and
cancellation after submission belong to PS5 Notifications.

Console validation remains necessary: mixed-source queues; cancellation followed
by another upload; disconnecting SMB/USB; multipart swaps; browser close and
reload; and offline base/update/DLC submission with rejected system requests.
Host tests do not establish actual AppInstUtil acceptance behavior on firmware.
