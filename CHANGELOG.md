## v1.4.1-argo

- Group backport packages with their matching games and provide a dedicated Backport section
- Fix backport installation progress totals and completion tracking

## v1.4.1

- Fixed USB and disc installs failing when the console had no active network connection. Installation progress is not shown in PKG Manager in this mode due to a PS5 system limitation.

## v1.4.0

### SMB Network Shares

- Fixed package scanning from the share root so an unreadable subfolder does not prevent scanning accessible folders
- Fixed guest authentication to try an empty-password Guest login, with anonymous fallback when no credentials are supplied
- Fixed page reloads on a Samba share package list showing an internal share ID instead of the share name
- Added clearer errors for disabled accounts and allowed entering share names when the server blocks share listing
- Reduced SMB signing overhead with hardware AES acceleration and reused encryption setup, while preserving signature verification
- Build the pinned, patched SMB library with matching headers instead of using an older SDK copy
- Added Windows 11 guest-sharing setup instructions and a host diagnostic tool for authentication, read verification and transfer benchmarks

### Settings
- Fixed cache statistics showing zero after reloading the Settings page
- Added a Close PKG Manager action that stops the server process gracefully
- Reorganized Settings cards

### Installation
- Fail fast and show a clear error if trying to install a package that no longer exists on storage or Samba
- Show the game title, update version, or DLC label instead of raw title IDs in console install notifications and download cards
- Show the package icon on the console's download cards and notifications during installation

### Cache and Scanning
- Preserve the metadata and icon cache across routine ELF updates; clear and rescan only when the cache schema changes
- Switched the Rescan button to run a fast quick rescan instead of rebuilding the full cache
- Fixed quick rescan dropping unchanged SMB packages when a package was renamed or modified, and added catalog self-healing

---

## v1.3.0

### Installation
- Fixed an issue reported on firmware 9.60 and newer where installing another package required restarting PKG Manager

### SMB Network Shares
- Added folder browsing so packages on large shares can be installed without scanning the whole share first
- Stopped repeated automatic scans of SMB shares
- Split package lists into pages for faster browsing of large libraries
- Keep saved passwords when editing a share

---

## v1.2.4

### Direct Install
- Improved transfer speeds to around 110 MB/s on a fast local network
- Added an optional live speed display and more helpful diagnostic logs
- Limit stored stream and SMB debug logs to the 20 most recent of each

---

## v1.2.3

### Startup Reliability
- Fixed startup failures affecting some users by making process discovery safer across PS5 environments, improving initialization ordering, and adding earlier diagnostics and notifications when startup steps fail

### Installation
- Fixed the Base + Update handoff so the update is queued by the native installer and continues even if the browser is closed after starting the base installation

### SMB Network Shares
- Added guided share selection and folder browsing, so share names and paths no longer need to be entered manually
- Preserve saved credentials when browsing an edited share whose password is masked in the UI, avoiding accidental guest logins
- Treat SMB sources consistently as read-only without attempting a network write-permission probe

### Browser Navigation
- Fixed browser Back/Forward navigation so returning to the app after visiting another page preserves the app's main page and menu history

---

## v1.2.2

### Package Detection
- Fixed PS4 base packages being incorrectly identified as DLC

### Cache and Scanning
- Cache is cleared and the package catalog is rescanned automatically after an app update; clearing the cache manually also refreshes the catalog

---

## v1.2.1

### Direct Install
- PKG files can now be installed from another device, such as a PC, directly to the console without a temporary disk copy

### Networking
- Moved package streaming and Direct Install services to ports `18841` and `18842` to avoid potential conflicts with other homebrew applications. The web interface remains on port `8844`.

### SMB Streaming
- Improved SMB package streaming performance, reaching approximately 110 MB/s during installs in ideal conditions
- Added streaming diagnostics to help identify network and server bottlenecks

### Extended USB Storage
- Available-space checks now include extended USB storage (`/mnt/ext0`)

### Package Badges
- PS4 and PS5 package badges are now shown in package lists

### Package Detection and Scanning
- Fixed detection of PS5 DLC packages
- Fixed drive scans hiding other packages when an unknown package was present, such as during a copy operation

---

## v1.1.0

### Multi-Language PKG Titles
- Package titles now display in your browser's preferred language instead of the first available entry

### Controller Navigation (PS5 Browser)
- **Circle button** navigates back through pages instead of immediately closing the browser
- Pressing Circle on the root Drive Select screen or during installation still closes the browser
- Modals block spatial navigation in the background while open

### SMB Diagnostics
- SMB connection testing now shows clearer, actionable error messages — making it easier to diagnose Windows share issues

### Storage Display
- The header now shows free space for **Internal** and **M.2** drives separately
- Installation is blocked when there isn't enough free space on any available drive
